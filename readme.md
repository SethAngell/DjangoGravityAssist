# Django Gravity Assist
A starter template for Django projects which meets the following requirements:
* Dockerized for ease of startup
* Django Rest Framework installed
* Authentication endpoints set up for DjangoRest Framework
* Pytest installed for testing
* Custom User Model pre-instantiated
* Github Actions Set up for testing


## Inspiration
This project is heavily inspired by [Will Vincents DRFx Repository](https://github.com/wsvincent/drfx), with a few of my opinions included as well as some niceties that I prefer in my projects:
* Whether it's used or not, it's nice to have pytest installed and set up before getting started
* Similiarly, I host exclusively on Github. So a basic github actions workflow is nice
* Docker from the start, simply because it's nice to be able to jump right into a new project without setting up requirements
* pip + requirements.txt for dependency management
